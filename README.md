User Stories

A User should see two buttons side-by-side on the home page with an option to select either existing user or new user.

A User will be sent to either the login page, if they're an existing user, or a signup page if they're a new user to my app.

A User will be sent to a page with a search bar and the ability to search albums.

The results of the users' search will be yielded on the page similar to our CatchPhrase.ly app.

The videos that the user will see will be interviews by the artist regarding the searched album.
